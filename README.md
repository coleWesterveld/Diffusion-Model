My first try at a diffusion model, just cause I think how they work is cool and I wanted to make one. 
I am following this Youtube tutorial:
"Coding Stable Diffusion from scratch in PyTorch" by Umar Jamil
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZBKpAp_6TGI&t=3162s&ab_channel=UmarJamil
so much of the code will probably be very similar / almost copied 
hopefully though I can then modify it to do something cooler
